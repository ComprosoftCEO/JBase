# JBase
Java Database Engine

## About
JBase was the final project for my Computing II class at IUPUI (CSCI-24000). I wrote this simple database engine to demonstrate my understanding
of object-oriented-programming, abstract data types, and my ability to create a complex software system. While not perfect, I am very happy with
the final result.
